## Description

This website was created to provide a traveler the ability to see the weather outlook for multiple cities so that they can plan their trip accordingly. The website retrieves data from the Open Weather Map website using a custom API along with an assigned API Key. The code used in this website dynamically updates HTML and CSS within the webpage.
